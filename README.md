# Pictionary

This is currently just a program to fetch words from an existing game.

It takes the words in the form of images (with their category information), and applies an OCR on it to recognize
actual words.

Regular dictionaries are not enough because words need to be categorized. Also some words in dictionaries are not very
well suited for the game.
